### What I learned

Today I completed the **Product Preview Card Component** challenge from Frontend Mentor. üõçÔ∏è I started by trying on my own, but my code was messy and unorganized. After watching Kevin Powell‚Äôs tutorial, I learned how to structure my HTML & CSS systematically. His approach really helped me think clearly!

‚ú® **What I learned today:**

- ‚úÖ How to use `[data-icon="shopping-cart"]` for flexible button icons
- ‚úÖ `display: inline-flex` for perfect alignment inside buttons
- ‚úÖ Responsive images with `<source srcset="">` for better UX on different devices
- ‚úÖ `flex-wrap` to make flex items adapt nicely on smaller screens

üí™ **My biggest struggle today** was understanding how to combine semantic HTML with responsive design. It took me a while to make the layout work well on both mobile and desktop. But I‚Äôm proud of the final result!
