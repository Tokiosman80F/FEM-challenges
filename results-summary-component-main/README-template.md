## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

✅ **aspect-ratio: 1/1** – An easy way to create perfect squares without hacks.

✅ **border-radius: 100vw** – Achieves fully pill-shaped buttons or elements by setting a very large radius.

✅ **color-mix()** – A modern CSS function to blend two colors directly.

✅ **line-height in buttons** – Understanding how `line-height` affects text vertical alignment and overall button height for better appearance and accessibility.

## Struggles

- Figuring out how to apply dynamic text colors and semi-transparent background colors using CSS variables.

- Learning and using `color-mix()` for the first time, including browser support considerations.
